# Comprehending Command Writeup

## Challenge Overview & New Concepts/Commands
Here the tasks were basically to read files using `Cat` commands in various steps. We learned about commands like `ls` listind folders `grep` finding for something 
`touch` creating files `rm` removing files `mkdir` for making directories `find` to find files by name `find -name my_subdirectory` to find files by name `ls -a` for showing even hidden files.
`ln -s` known as symlinks ,for linking files (origin files comes first) & `file` command to know about the file type . We learned about the Hard link and Soft/Symbolic Link.
## Thought Process
I just went to different directories using `cd` when required and read the content `cat` to find the flags. 
Sometimes I had to find files or copy the contents from one to another or even delete few files to ultimately capture the flag.
## Steps Taken
- I executed the command as mentioned above, and did some errors to react to the actual flag,
and got the flags.
- In some cases files were hidden or we were required to create certain files.
- In one case we also had to delete the files to get to the required flags.
- Sometimes there were multiple files so we had to apply hit and try method.
