find -name flag 2>/dev/null
/challenge/challenge --giveflag

IN second I had to use `find -name flag 2>/dev/null` to find the flag and then use `/challenge/challenge --printfile ./flag` to get the flag

IN third I had to read manual using `man challenge` then got the argument specified in the document to get the flag and captured the flag using `/challenge/challenge --wtnthn 683`

IN fourth I had to read manual again and then used `/flag` to search the flag keyword and used `n` to shift to the next result.

IN fifth I has to read about the man page itself using `man man` command and then the same procedure as the previous one.

IN Sixth I had to use the `-h/-help` command to read about the challenge and then use a secret key and ultimately getting the flag.

IN Seventh I learned about the buitlins like directly using help command
