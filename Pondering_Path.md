# Pondering Path Writeup

## Challenge Overview
In this module, the challenge was to change directories and capture the flag. We learned in this module about the difference between relative and absolute paths. 
How to check the present working directories and lastly about the home directory.

## Thought Process
I solved the Quests by switching to the respective mentioned directories and capturing the flags.

## Steps Taken
I had to execute the command 
```
/program/run
```
most of the times to capture the flags , Its just sometime relative way or absolute by changing directories, using `cd`
last was to copy the content to home directory and then display so I created a file `touch ~/a`
in the home directory and then copied the contents and hence got the flag.
